<p class="dropCap">During my one year internship at Nettiaika Oy (2017-2018) as a Graphic web designer I designed the optikkomanski.fi website. Total transformation was made on the outlook of the website and the design is still used to this day. Tools used: Photoshop</p>

<p>Optikko manski website is built upon the wordpress content management platform</p>
