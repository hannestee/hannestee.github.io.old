<p class="dropCap">The goal of this thesis was to study the features and technology related to progressive web applications and to build two prototype progressive web applications. The goal was also to examine if progressive web applications could be of use in increasing business growth. Progressive web applications enhance regular websites in a way that they work like native applications. They bring many features to a normal website such as ability to install them on the home screen and partial availability with bad internet connections or offline. Progressive web applications can be used to make user experiences better and to bring more value to a business web page.</p>

<p>This thesis examines if there are any opportunities for progressive web applications increasing business growth. In addition, it covers the process of adding progressive web application features to a web page in two different prototype applications in practice. One of the prototype applications is built into the Wordpress content management system. The other is built with the Angular web framework. The study concluded that transforming a website to a progressive web application enhances the usability of the application which in turn can have a positive effect on business growth.</p>

<p>The final result of the project is two prototype applications that can be used to browse pro-ducts much like in an online shop. The applications utilize the features of progressive web applications and are also optimized and checked by using Google Lighthouse tool. Both of the applications passed the check successfully and meet the requirements for a progressive web application.</p>
